# Contributing

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an FPAC open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask â€” submit your issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is we'll politely ask you to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions, whether they be from FPAC collaborators or citizens alike.

One of our goals is to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors to our projects. Our staff follows the [FSA Employee Responsibilities and Conduct](http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/hrdapp?area=home&subject=labr&topic=erc), and all contributors should do the same.

<!-- We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](../LICENSE.md), [README](../README.md) and its [Workflow](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/wiki/Workflow) process.

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository](https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov). -->

### Building fsa-style locally with Grunt

The FPAC Design System's [fsa-style](https://github.com/USDA-FSA/fsa-style) package (the ZIP download or contents of published NPM module) and Design System website (our public site that displays examples of each component and the HTML code) are built using Grunt automation. To use Grunt, first make sure you've installed it on your machine globally.

```sh
npm install --global grunt-cli
```

Then, to start, run the following command to install any new dependencies and run the default Grunt task:

```sh
npm start
```
