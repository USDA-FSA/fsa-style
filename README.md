USDA Farm Service Agency's **Visual Language** and **HTML/CSS Framework**.

It was created and maintained by the FSA Office of Architecture, and is heavily influenced by the [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) created and maintained by the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/).

## Reuse of open-source style guides

This Design System was initially based on the [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) created and maintained by the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) designers and developers. The Draft U.S. Web Design Standards are designed for use by government product teams who want to create beautiful, easy-to-use online experiences for the public. To learn more about the project, check out [their blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/).
