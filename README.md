# FSA Design System

The **FSA Design System** is an Open Source product of HTML/CSS components and an accompanying Visual Style Guide for use on USDA-FSA web sites and apps.

It was created and maintained by the Farm Service Agency Office of Architecture, and is heavily influenced by the [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) created and maintained by the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/)

These tools follow industry-standard web accessibility guidelines and use the best practices of existing style libraries and modern web design.

## Reuse of open-source style guides

This Design System was initially based on the [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) created and maintained by the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) designers and developers. The Draft U.S. Web Design Standards are designed for use by government product teams who want to create beautiful, easy-to-use online experiences for the public.
